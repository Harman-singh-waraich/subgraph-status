[Demo](https://subgraph-status.vercel.app) ðŸš€

---

## Getting Started 
	

    yarn add subgraph-status

--- 

### Usage

#### UI Display

 Exports StatusBanner and StatusCard, to display status of multiple subgraphs with a carousel effect.

    import {StatusBanner, StatusCard} from "subgraph-status";
    
	function  App()  {
		return (
            <>
		    <StatusBanner subgraphs={[{name: "Subgraph 1" , url : "subgraphUrl"}]}/>
		    <StatusCard subgraphs={[{name: "Subgraph 1" , url : "subgraphUrl"}]}/>
            </>
		);
	}

#### useWatcher hook

Exports a hook that takes in the subgraphs and return the Statuses respectively. Use this if you want to build your own UI around it.

    import { useWatcher } from "subgraph-status";
    
	function  App()  {
        const {statuses, isLoadingIds, isLoadingStatus} = useWatcher([{name: "Subgraph 1" , url : "subgraphUrl"}, {name: "Subgraph 2" , url : "subgraphUrl"}]);

		return (
            <>
                // Display statuses.
            </>
		);
	}

> Subgraph url is the query url that is used to make gql requests.
